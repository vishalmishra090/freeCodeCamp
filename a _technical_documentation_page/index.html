          Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you
          to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all
          with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large
          stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within
          and across projects.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sass facilitates you to write clean, easy and less CSS in a
            programming construct.
          </li>
          <li>It contains fewer codes so you can write CSS quicker.</li>
          <li>
            It is more stable, powerful, and elegant because it is an
            extension of CSS. So, it is easy for designers and developers to
            work more efficiently and quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is compatible with all versions of CSS. So, you can use any
            available CSS libraries.
          </li>
          <li>
            It provides nesting so you can use nested syntax and useful
            functions like color manipulation, math functions and other
            values.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What You Should Already Know</h3>
        <p>
          Before you continue you should have a basic understanding of the
          following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Install_Sass">
      <header>Install Sass</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          When you install Sass on the command line, you'll be able to run the
          <code>sass</code> executable to compile <code>.sass</code> and
          <code>.scss</code> files to <code>.css</code> files. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css</code></pre>
        <h2>Install Anywhere (Standalone)</h2>
        <p>
          You can install Sass on Windows, Mac, or Linux by downloading the
          package for your operating system
          <a href="https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.32.8">
            from GitHub</a>
          and
          <a href="https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/">adding it to your <code>PATH</code></a>. That’s all—there are no
          external dependencies and nothing else
          you need to install.
        </p>
        <h2>Install Anywhere (npm)</h2>

        <p>
          If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> by running
        </p>

        <pre><code>npm install -g sass</code></pre>

        <p>
          <strong>However, please note</strong> that this will install the
          pure JavaScript implementation of Sass, which runs somewhat slower
          than the other options listed here. But it has the same interface,
          so it’ll be easy to swap in another implementation later if you need
          a bit more speed!
        </p>

      <header>Preprocessing</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more
          complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can
          help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like
          variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that
          make writing CSS fun again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed
          Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once
          Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the
          <code>sass</code> command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to
          build from, and where to output CSS to. For example, running
          <code>sass input.scss output.css</code> from your terminal would
          take a single Sass file, <code>input.scss</code>, and compile that
          file to <code>output.css</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also watch individual files or directories with the
          <code>--watch</code> flag. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your
          source files for changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your
          Sass. If you wanted to watch (instead of manually build) your
          <code>input.scss</code> file, you'd just add the watch flag to your
          command, like so:
        </p>
        <pre><code>sass --watch input.scss output.css</code></pre>
        <p>
          You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as
          your input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this
          example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets</code></pre>
        <p>
          Sass would watch all files in the <code>app/sass</code> folder for
          changes, and compile CSS to the
          <code>public/stylesheets</code> folder.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to
          reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors,
          font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass
          uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. Here's an example:
        </p>

        <p><b>SASS</b></p>

        <pre><code>$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif
$primary-color: #333
              
body
  font: 100% $font-stack
  color: $primary-color</code></pre>

        <p><b>CSS</b></p>

        <pre><code>body {
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
} </code></pre>

        <p>
          When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the
          $font-stack and $primary-color and outputs normal CSS with our
          variable values placed in the CSS. This can be extremely powerful
          when working with brand colors and keeping them consistent
          throughout the site.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Nesting">
      <header>Nesting</header>
      <p>
        When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested
        and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the
        same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly nested rules
        will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain
        and is generally considered bad practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that in mind, here's an example of some typical styles for a
        site's navigation:
      </p>

      <p><b>SASS</b></p>

      <pre><code>nav
  ul
    margin: 0
    padding: 0
    list-style: none

  li
    display: inline-block

  a
    display: block
    padding: 6px 12px
    text-decoration: none
</code></pre>

      <p><b>CSS</b></p>

      <pre><code>nav ul {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
nav li {
  display: inline-block;
}
nav a {
  display: block;
  padding: 6px 12px;
  text-decoration: none;
}</code></pre>

      <p>
        You'll notice that the ul, li, and a selectors are nested inside the
        nav selector. This is a great way to organize your CSS and make it
        more readable.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Partials">
      <header>Partials</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of
          CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to
          modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A
          partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might
          name it something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know
          that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be
          generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @use
          rule.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Modules">
      <header>Modules</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          You don't have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can
          split it up however you want with the @use rule. This rule loads
          another Sass file as a module, which means you can refer to its
          variables, mixins, and functions in your Sass file with a namespace
          based on the filename. Using a file will also include the CSS it
          generates in your compiled output!
        </p>

        <p><b>SASS</b></p>

        <pre><code>// _base.sass
$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif
$primary-color: #333

body
  font: 100% $font-stack
  color: $primary-color</code></pre>
        <pre><code>// styles.sass
@use 'base'

.inverse
  background-color: base.$primary-color
  color: white</code></pre>

        <p><b>CSS</b></p>

        <pre><code>body {
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: #333; 
}
              
.inverse {
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          Notice we're using @use 'base'; in the styles.scss file. When you
          use a file you don't need to include the file extension. Sass is
          smart and will figure it out for you.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Mixins">
      <header>Mixins</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3
          and the many vendor prefixes that exist. A mixin lets you make
          groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your
          site. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible.
          A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes. Here's an example for
          transform.
        </p>

        <p><b>SASS</b></p>
        
        <pre><code>=transform($property)
  -webkit-transform: $property
  -ms-transform: $property
  transform: $property

.box
  +transform(rotate(30deg))</code></pre>

        <p><b>CSS</b></p>

        <pre><code>.box {
  -webkit-transform: rotate(30deg);
  -ms-transform: rotate(30deg);
  transform: rotate(30deg);
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          To create a mixin you use the @mixin directive and give it a name.
          We've named our mixin transform. We're also using the variable
          $property inside the parentheses so we can pass in a transform of
          whatever we want. After you create your mixin, you can then use it
          as a CSS declaration starting with @include followed by the name of
          the mixin.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Extend/Inheritance">
      <header>Extend/Inheritance</header>
      <article>
        <p>This is one of the most useful features of Sass. Using @extend lets
        you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It
        helps keep your Sass very DRY. In our example we're going to create a
        simple series of messaging for errors, warnings and successes using
        another feature which goes hand in hand with extend, placeholder
        classes. A placeholder class is a special type of class that only
        prints when it is extended, and can help keep your compiled CSS neat
        and clean.</p>
        <p><b>SASS</b></p>
        <pre><code>/* This CSS will print because %message-shared is extended. */
%message-shared
  border: 1px solid #ccc
  padding: 10px
  color: #333

// This CSS won't print because %equal-heights is never extended.
%equal-heights
  display: flex
  flex-wrap: wrap

.message
  @extend %message-shared

.success
  @extend %message-shared
  border-color: green

.error
  @extend %message-shared
  border-color: red

.warning
  @extend %message-shared
  border-color: yellow</code></pre>

      </article>
      <p>
        What the above code does is tells .message, .success, .error, and
        .warning to behave just like %message-shared. That means anywhere that
        %message-shared shows up, .message, .success, .error, & .warning will
        too. The magic happens in the generated CSS, where each of these
        classes will get the same CSS properties as %message-shared. This
        helps you avoid having to write multiple class names on HTML elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can extend most simple CSS selectors in addition to placeholder
        classes in Sass, but using placeholders is the easiest way to make
        sure you aren't extending a class that's nested elsewhere in your
        styles, which can result in unintended selectors in your CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the CSS in %equal-heights isn't generated, because
        %equal-heights is never extended.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Operators">
      <header>Operators</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Doing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass has a handful of
          standard math operators like +, -, *, /, and %. In our example we're
          going to do some simple math to calculate widths for an aside &
          article.
        </p>
        <p><b>SASS</b></p>
        <pre><code>.container
  width: 100%

article[role="main"]
  float: left
  width: 600px / 960px * 100%

aside[role="complementary"]
  float: right
  width: 300px / 960px * 100%</code></pre>

        <p><b>CSS</b></p>
        <pre><code>.container {
  width: 100%;
}
              
article[role="main"] {
  float: left;
  width: 62.5%;
}
              
aside[role="complementary"] {
  float: right;
  width: 31.25%;
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          We've created a very simple fluid grid, based on 960px. Operations
          in Sass let us do something like take pixel values and convert them
          to percentages without much hassle.
